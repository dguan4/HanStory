# Fire Emblem Fates: The Untold Story

A RPG game made with PyGame on Python

## How to run

You must have PyGame and Python installed (1.9.1 was used with this project, along with Python 3.5.1)
After that, simply run the gameloop file in the src folder (i.e. python3 gameloop.py)

## Summary

This story is loosely based on a reddit post that I read about Hans, which was fairly satirical

Hans is manipulated by Garon to kill Corrin when Corrin is tasked to test his/her strength (I shall refer to Corrin as a male from here on).
Hans believed he was testing Corrin's strength, which caused a multitude of events to occur such as the *death* of Gunter

In the routes Corrin chooses, he finds Hans again going against him. Being a prisoner and someone manipulated by Garon,
he has no choice but to obey Garon's orders. What else is he supposed to do? He can't simply join Corrin's side.

However, Hans helps Corrin out quite often, most notably during the Conquest route when he kills the enemies for Corrin
Thus is the untold story of the unsung hero, Hans

Unfinished project, may work on if I have time later
